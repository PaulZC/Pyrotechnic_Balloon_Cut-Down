# Pyrotechnic Balloon Cut-Down Device

## Cutter Assembly

A lightweight wireless cut-down device for use on high altitude balloons.

The cutter has been designed to reliably sever size 4N (2.4mm) braided nylon cord.

### Drawings

The [Drawings](https://github.com/PaulZC/Pyrotechnic_Balloon_Cut-Down/tree/master/Archive/V1/Drawings) directory contains the drawings for the mechanical parts plus an
assembly drawing.

### Use and Storage

Prepare the cutter as close as possible to the time of your flight, to minimise the possibility of the powder becoming damp.

If this is not possible, store the assembled cutter in a sealed box with a large sachet of fresh dessiccant.

### Prepare the Electric Match

The cutter is ignited by an [MJG Technologies J-Tek1 igniter](https://electricmatch.com/pyrotechnics/see/9/5/j-tek-igniter). Made in the USA, these
are readily available from fireworks display suppliers in many countries including the UK. Technical information is available on the
[MJG Technologies website](https://electricmatch.com/upload/JTEK_TECHNICAL_INFORMATION_SHEET_SPECIFICATIONS.PDF).

The igniter contains a 1.0 ohm nichrome wire which, when heated by a current of 1 Amp or more, ignites the pyrotechnic 'match head'. The J-Tek1 can be
triggered by a single AAA alkaline battery.

Remove the black protective cover from the end of the igniter wires and ensure the bare copper wires are twised securely together. This shorts the
igniter, preventing it from being ignited accidentally by a static discharge.

Remove the red plastic cover by pushing it off the match head and sliding it along the wire.

Slide a McMaster 1173N004 silicone o-ring (0.070" internal diameter) along the igniter wire until it almost touches the solder joint. This o-ring will
help prevent the gas from the powder escaping through the hex head screw.

Slide a McMaster 1173N005 silicone o-ring (0.101" ID) over the match head as shown in the assembly drawing. This o-ring will prevent the igniter from making
electrical contact with the conductive aluminium cutter body.

Poke the bare ends of the wires through a McMaster 93306A580 aluminium hex head screw, which has been drilled through with a 7/64" (2.8mm) drill bit. Slide the
screw along the wires until it touches the smaller o-ring.

Keep the igniter wires shorted together until the cutter is complete and you are ready to connect it to the cut-down circuit board.

### Add the Smokeless Powder

Check that the inside of the cutter body is clean, dry and free from debris. Clean it with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol (rubbing alcohol or Isopropyl
Alcohol (IPA)) if required. Use a size F reamer (McMaster 89485A46) by hand to clear any stubborn deposits or burrs from the cord holes.

Insert a paper clip through the cord holes and bend it to prevent it falling out.

Slide a clean McMaster 98105A090 dowel pin into the cutter body, inserting the flatter end first. The paper clip prevents the dowel pin from sliding past the cord
holes.

Stand the cutter body upright and using a small funnel (normally used to refill perfume bottles), pour 1.5 grains (0.10 grams) of smokeless powder into the cutter
body so it ends up on top of the dowel pin. Ensure the funnel is clean and dry before use. 0.10 grams of powder is the same amount found inside a Fiocchi 8mm NIK
starting pistol blank.

### Assemble the Cutter

Feed the igniter assembly through the cut-down circuit board and then screw it carefully into the cutter body. Orient the holes in the cutter body so they
are vertical with respect to the circuit board, then tighten the screw using a spanner. Do not overtighten the screw.

### Connect the Cutter

Cut the igniter wires short. Part the wires and remove 5mm of insulation from the end of each wire. Push the bare wire ends into the green terminal block
on the cut-down circuit board. You do not need to press the orange levers on the terminal block while you do this. The levers only need to be pressed when
releasing the wires.

Your cutter is ready for use.

You may need to melt and shape the cut end of the nylon cord so it will slide easily through the cord holes.

### Reuse

After use, the dowel pin will end up trapped at the end of the cutter body, almost certainly jammed in place by remnants of nylon cord. You may need to drive
a parallel pin punch (McMaster 3416A24) into the hole in the end of the cutter body to release it. Take care to hold the pin punch on axis so as not to damage
the reamed bore of the cutter body.

Clean the dowel pin with cotton wool dipped in alcohol (rubbing alcohol or IPA). Clean the cutter body with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol.

Use a size F reamer (McMaster 89485A46) by hand to clear any stubborn deposits or burrs from the cord holes.

Use new o-rings each time even if they look intact.
